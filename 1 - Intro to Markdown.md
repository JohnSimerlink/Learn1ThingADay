##Markdown Summary
(Summarized from memory after following leessons 1 through 7 of http://markdowntutorial.com/lesson/7/)

_Italics_ - surrond with "_"'s

**Bold** - surround with **'s

###Headers - use # through ######. use 1 and 6 sparingly

[Link](www.google.com) - use \[\text\]\(link\) syntax.

[A reference/dynamic link][link1] - use [text][linkname] syntax and define link1 at the bottom of the page with a [linkname]: link syntax on its own line


Make images with regular link or internal (aka "reference" link) link syntax, but by placing a "!" before the intial []

> Blockquote - Make a blockquote by starting a paragraph with ">"

This is a list:

* Item 1
* Item 2

This is an ordered list:

1. one
2. two
3. three

Another way is to use two spaces at the end of the numbered line as explained in the hard/soft breaks section below

1. item 1  
the above line ends in two spaces
2. item 2

Hard Breaks/Soft breaks - One line break between two lines won't create a new paragraph. Two line breaks will, however, it will put an extra space between the two paragprahs. To simply start a new line use a soft break by adding two spaces at the end of the line  
^^That is how this line is directly below the above line, whereas my previous lines are all separated like individual parapraphs.

escape special characters with "\"
