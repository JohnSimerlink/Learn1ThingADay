types of artificial neurons)
#####Chapter 1
* perceptrons:
	output = 0 if w . x + b <= 0
		   = 1 if w . x + b > 0,
		   where w is a vector of weights,
		   and x is a vector of binary inputs
* sigmoid neuron
	-sigmoid function:
		σ(z) = 1 / (1 + e^-z)
		so if z = w . x + b, where x can take on any value on not just a binary enum
		then σ(z) = 1 / (1 + e^-(w . x + b))
