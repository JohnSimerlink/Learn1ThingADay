### Doing Processor Architecures

Phases - P Double M T M

* Purpose(Requirements) - is the processor for a watch? some iOT device?
  * Performance?
  * Reliability, fault tolerant?
  * Power Consumption?
  * Functionality?
  * Cost Oriented?
  * ^^^ PRP FC
* Modeling
* Microarchitecture Implementation ? - what exactly is this
* Testing & Verification - is design working? timing working? if not go back in process.
* Manufacturing
