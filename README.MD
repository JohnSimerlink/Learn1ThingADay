##My Plan To Learn at least 1 Thing in Programming a day

Rules

1. I must learn at least 1 new thing a day
2. I'm not allowed to simply read about the thing I am learning. I must type out the code or implement the idea myself.
3. I must understand what I learn each day. E.g. I need to be able to replicate what I learned in different scenarios on my own. No copy/paste/"script-kiddie" behavior is allowed.


####Daily Progress
* Day Two (09/28/2015) - Started Learning Neural Networks; perceptron, sigmoid
* Day One (09/27/2015) - Learned the basics of markdown


####Future Ideas
* Forking and branching and pull requests in github
* Functional Programming
* AI/Neural Networks
* Modern dev workflow behavior - TDD, Jenkins, grunt,  npm, amd
* Writing partial implementations of many "black boxes" I use - Jquery, Twitter Bootstrap, a web server, git, rendering engines
* Automating stuff
* Knuth TAOCP
